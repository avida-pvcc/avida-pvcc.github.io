                        <li>Design:	This phase involves creating a plan for the construction of the proposed system.  Developing a solution to the problem put forth during requirement analysis.</li>
                        <li>Implementation:	This phase involves the actual writing of programs, creation of data files, and development of databases.</li>
                        <li>Testing:	In the traditional development phase of the past, testing was essentially equated with the process of debugging programs and confirming that the final software product was compatible with the software requirements specification.  Today, this vision of testing is considered far too narrow.  It is thought that testing should be incorporated into each phase of the Software Life Cycle.</li>
