                    <b>CSMA/CD Ethernet:</b><br> Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Detection - A protocol used in Ethernet based bus networks which dictates that each message be broadcast to all the machines on the bus.  Each machine monitors all the messages but keeps only those addressed to itself.<br><br>
                    <b>CSMA/CA Wifi:</b><br>Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance - Protocols designed to avoid collisions within a wireless environment and may not eliminate them completely.<br><br>

                    <b>Repeater:</b><br>A simple device used to send signals back and forth between two seperate buses without considering the meaning of the signals.<br><br>
                    <b>Bridge:</b><br>Like a repeater, it connects two buses, but it does not necessarily pass all messages across the connection.  Instead, it looks at the destination address that accompanies each message and forwards a message across the connection only when that message is destined for a computer on the other side. Thus, two machines residing on the same side of a bridge can exchange messages without interferring with communication taking place on the other side.<br><br>
                    <b>Switch:</b><br>Essentially a bridge with multiple connections, allowing it to connect several buses rather than just two.  Thus, a switch produces a network consisting of several buses extending from the switch, as spokes on a wheel.<br><br>
                    <b>Router:</b><br>A device used to handle connections between networks to from an internet.  Routers provide links between networks while allowing each network to maintain its unique internal characteristics.<br><br>
                    <b>Gateway:</b><br>The point at which one network is linked to an internet.  The gateway serves as a passageway between the network and the outside world.<br><br>

                    <b>Tier 2:</b><br>ISPs connected to Tier 1 ISPs that tend to be more regional in scope and less potent in their capabilities. These networks tend to be operated by companies in the communications business.<br><br>
                    <b>Tier 3:</b><br>An access ISP that is essentially an independent Internet, sometimes called an Intranet, operated by a single authority that is in the business of supplying Internet access to individual homes and businesses.<br><br>

This entity awards blocks of consecutively numbered IP addresses to ISPs.

                    <b>DNS:</b><br>Domain NameSystem - an Internet-wide collection of name servers.  Name servers convert human readable destinations (websites) to IP addresses of servers in order to access webpage information in a readable format.<br><br>

                    <b>Transport layer:</b><br>This layer is used by the application layer to send and receive messages ofver the Internet in much the same way that you would use a shipping company to send and receive packages. An important task of the trasport layer is to accept messages from the application layer and to ensure that the messages are properly fomratted for transmission over the Internet.<br><br>
                    <b>Network layer:</b><br>This layer receives packets from the transport layer.  The network layer's job is to decide in which direction a packet should be sent at each step along the packet's path through the Internet.<br><br>
                    <b>Link layer:</b><br>This layer has the responsibility of transferring the packet.  The link layer must deal with the communication details particular to the individual network in which the computer resides.  For instance, if that network is an Ethernet, the link layber applies CSMA/CD, and if the network is a WiFi network, the link layer applies CSMA/CA.<br><br>

                    <b>Worm:</b><br>An autonomous program that transfers itself through a network, taking up residence in computers and forwarding copies of itself to other computers. A worm can be designed merely to replicate itself or to perform more extreme vandalism. A characteristic consequence of a worm is an esplosion of the worm's replicated copies that degrades the performance of legitimate applications and can ultimately overload an entire network or internet.<br><br>
                    <b>Trojan horse:</b><br>A program that enters a omputer system disguised as a desirable program, such as a game or useful utility package, that is willingly imported by the victim.
