            <p>&emsp;&emsp;The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) came into being in 1978 as a result of restructuring an organization from the Executive Branch and the Commerce Department.</p>  

            <p>&emsp;&emsp;This reorganization was included in Reorganization Plan Number 1 in 1977 and put into place by Executive Order 12046 in 1978.  This executive order combined the roles and responsibilities of the Office of Telecommunications Policy (OTP) from the White House and the Office of Telecommunications which was previously under the Commerce Department.</p> 

            <p>&emsp;&emsp;This reorganization essentially transferred the power held by the Executive Branch to the Commerce Department making the Assistant Secretary of Commerce the President’s chief advisor in matters of telecommunications both domestically and internationally.</p>
