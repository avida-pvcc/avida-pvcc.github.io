            <ul>
                <td><b>Operating System: </b><br>The software that controls the overall operation of a computer. It provides the means by which a user can store and retrieve files, provides the interface by which a user can request the execution of programs, and provides the environment necessary to to execute the prorams requested.<br><br>
                    <b>Job Queue: </b><br>In batch processing systems, the jobs residing in mass storage wait for execution in a queue.  This queue organizes jobs in a first-in, first-out fashion.<br><br>
                    <b>FIFO: </b><br>An abbreviation for "First-in, First-out" meaning objects are removed from the queue in the order in which they arrived.<br><br>
                    <b>Interactive Processing: </b><br>A feature of operating systems that allow a program that is being executed to carry on a dialogue with the user through remote terminals.<br><br>
                    <b>Time-sharing: </b><br>A feature in operating systems designed to provide service to multiple users at the same time.<br><br>
                    <b>Multiprogramming: </b><br>The implimentation of time-sharing, in which time is divided into intervals and then the execution of each job is restricted to only one interval at a time.<br><br>
                    <b>Aplication Software: </b><br>Consists of the programs for performing specific tasks particular to the machine's utilization.<br><br>
                    <b>System Software: </b><br>Performs tasks that are common to computer systems in general. The system software provides the infrastructure that the application software requires.<br><br>
                    <b>Utility Software: </b><br>Software consisting of programs for performing activities that are fundamental to the computer installations but not included in the operating system.<br><br>
                    <b>Graphical User Interface (GUI): </b><br>The means in which objects are to be manipulated, such as files and programs, and are represented pictorially on the display as icons. <br><br>
                    <b>Shell: </b><br>An older user interface that communicates with the user through textual messages using a keyboard and monitory screen.<br><br>
                    <b>Kernel: </b><br>The internal part of an operating system, containing software components that perform the very basic functions required by the computer installation.<br><br>
                    <b>Device Driver: </b><br>A software unit that communicates with the controllers to carry out operations on the peripheral device (such as a printer, disk,or monitor) attached to the machine.<br><br>
                    <b>File Manager: </b><br>Maintains records of all the files stored in mass storage, including where each file is located, which users are allowed to access the various files, and which portions of mass storage are available for new files or extensions to existing files.<br><br>
                    <b>Memory Manager: </b><br>A component of the kernel which is charged with the task of coordinating the machine's use of main memory.<br><br>
                    <b>Virtual Memory: </b><br>A common technique used in a computer's operating system.  Virtual memory uses both hardware and software to enable a computer to compensate for physical memory shortages, temporarily transferring data from RAM to disk storage.<br><br>
                    <b>Boot Strapping: </b><br>This process is performed by a computer each time it is turned on. It is the procedure that transfers the operating system from mass storage (permanent storage location) into mail memory (which is empty when the machine is first turned on).<br><br>
                    <b>ROM: </b><br>Also known as "Read Only Memory".  This is a small portion of the main memory where the CPU finds its intial program. This memory is constructed from special nonvolatile memory cells.<br><br>
                    <b>Deadlock: </b><br>The condition in which two or more processes are blocked from progressing because each is waiting for a resource that is allocated to another.<br><br>
                    <b>Spooling: </b><br>A technique for granting several processes access to a common resource. A file manager may allocate file access according to the needs of the processes, allowing several processes to have read access but allowing only one to have write access, to mitigate conflicts.<br><br>
                    <b>Super User (or Administrator): </b><br>This user gains highly privileged access to the operating system by identifying them as the admin during the login procedure. The administrator can alter settings within the operating system, modify critical software packages, adjust the privileges granted to other users, and perform a variety of other mainntenance activities that are denied normal users.<br><br>
                    <b>Multi-factor Authentication: </b><br>A security process at login, that requires the user to enter a password as well as a special access code from a specialized security token, a smartphone with a particular phone number, or some form of unique biometrics in order to prove the user is in fact who they say they are.<br><br></td>
